Compute and return the square root of x.
## 74. Search a 2D Matrix  
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.  
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.  
## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array  
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
