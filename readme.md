Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.  
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."  
For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.  
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
## 275. H-Index II
Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order? Could you optimize your algorithm?

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.  
Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.  
For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
## 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence ***

For example,  
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],  
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4.Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.  
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.  
Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

## 371. Sum of Two Integers
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -. 
## 376. Wiggle Subsequence
A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.  
For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.  
Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.  
## 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.  
Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.  
## 392. Is Subsequence
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.  
You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).  
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).  
## 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
## 409. Longest Palindrome
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.  
This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.  
## 438. Find All Anagrams in a String
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.  
Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.  
The order of output does not matter.   
## 441. Arranging Coins
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.  
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.  
n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.  
## 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.  
Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
## 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
## 454. 4Sum II
Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.  
To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.  
## 339. Nested List Weight Sum

## 364. Nested List Weight Sum II
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.  
Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.  
Different from the previous question where weight is increasing from root to leaf, now the weight is defined from bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the largest weight.
