# Leetcode Questions
## 69. Sqrt(x)  
Implement int sqrt(int x).  
Compute and return the square root of x.
## 74. Search a 2D Matrix  
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.  
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.  
## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array  
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).  
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.  
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).  
Find the minimum element.  
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.  
## 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":  
What if duplicates are allowed?  
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?  
Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.
## 367. Valid Perfect Square
Given a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.  
Note: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.
## 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.  
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
## 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.  
For example,  
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],  
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4.Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.  
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.  
Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
